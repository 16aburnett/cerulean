# Cerulean Compiler Suite

Cerulean is a suite of programming languages, interpreters, and compilers.

The main purpose of this project is to explore making different compilers and programming languages. This is just meant to be a fun project and is meant to work similarly to something like [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) with multiple frontend compilers, an intermediate language, and backend compilers to different target languages. This is also expected to have custom programming languages and interpreters.

This project is currently a work-in-progress and there isnt a working compiler yet.
